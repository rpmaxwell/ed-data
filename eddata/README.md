# Eddata
Eddata pulls disparate data from files across agencies to compile an aggregated database of education data nationwide. 

## Setting up eddata:
1. Install dependencies listed in requirements.txt
2. set database creds as environment variables and run raw_data files
3. run dw scripts
4. notebooks should work as expected
